# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed Array sort writeback when an indexed setter mutates a successor
  element, Error.prototype.stack setter edge cases, and TypedArray
  DefineOwnProperty detach-during-conversion semantics.
- Removed the historical C QuickJS performance comparison workflow and
  `perf-compare`; the checked performance gate is the ZJS self-baseline.
- Added a `run_runtime_profile.js` helper and `zig build perf-uri-profile`
  shortcut for checked single-script `--perf-json` artifacts that stay separate
  from multi-case microbench reports.
- Extended checked runtime-profile artifacts with opcode summary rows and added
  opcode-specific runtime diff metrics such as `opcode_count:get_var_ref0`.
- Added deterministic opcode-count ceilings to checked runtime-profile runs so
  focused hot-path fusions fail loudly when their opcode reductions disappear.
- Added `diff_runtime_profile.js` so single-script runtime profiles can be
  compared with explicit timing/allocation regression and improvement gates.
- Added an empty checked-local int32 for-loop range skip for loops whose body is
  only the induction update, reducing the `empty_loop` profile from 60007
  opcodes to 7 while preserving interrupt fallback.
- Added a dense array indexed append fast path for simple int32 multiply/mask
  element expressions while preserving inherited indexed setter fallback.
- Added a var-local int32 arithmetic-store fast path for microbench-style loop
  bodies without changing loop condition or post-update semantics.
- Added narrow `String.fromCharCode` and `Math.min`/`Math.max` method-call fast
  paths that keep object coercion and monkey-patched methods on the generic
  call path.
- Added local, closure, and global simple-numeric bytecode call add-store fast
  paths for tight `acc += fn(i, c)` loops while preserving non-simple function
  side effects.
- Tightened the URI 4-byte decode comparison fast path to use a borrowed
  native-method guard instead of transient method value dup/free churn.
- Shortened the percent-hex simple string add-store path used by URI decode
  fixtures by avoiding the transient helper result value before global writeback.
- Added a guarded `make_var_ref` assignment fusion for `global = string +
  percentHex(int)` loops so reference setup and `put_ref_value` are skipped when
  all participating bindings are ordinary global data properties.
- Added matching global-string and literal-prefix declaration initializer
  fusions for `var next = prefix + percentHex(int)` and `var next = "%F0%A0" +
  percentHex(int)`, eliminating the URI 4-byte profile's remaining
  `get_var_ref0` executions.
- Added a backward-goto global int32 condition fusion that replays the target
  loop condition directly at the backedge when it is an ordinary global data
  comparison, reducing the URI 4-byte profile's `get_var` executions by 66576.
- Extended the URI strict-equality branch-count fusion to ordinary global data
  `count++`, reducing the URI 4-byte profile's `if_false8` executions from
  65536 to 1 and its `get_var` executions by another 65535.
- Refreshed active documentation to match the current build steps, test262
  boundary, ZJS self-baseline performance gate, and tracked active reports.
- Removed the completed Production v1 roadmap from the active docs; public API,
  compatibility, and release-checklist docs are the current authorities.
- Merged the small Compatibility v1 summary into `COMPATIBILITY.md` so the
  compatibility boundary has one active source of truth.
- Removed old one-off test262 slice and QuickJS comparison report directories
  from `reports/`; the active gate report remains `reports/test262-latest/`.
- Removed the future-oriented Bun/uWS GC design note from the active docs; the
  current GC boundary remains documented in `README.md` and `LIMITATIONS.md`.
- Removed the unused opcode-alignment report snapshot from `reports/`.
- Removed historical phase/ledger documents from the active tree:
  `docs/gc-memory-lifecycle-candidates.md`, `docs/perf/roadmap.md`, and
  `reports/perf/baseline/phase-a-baseline.md`.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 - 2026-05-22

- Added an explicit `--leak-check` CLI strategy to cleanly execute engine deinitialization (`runtime.deinit()`) and perform GPA memory validation on demand.
- Created `LIMITATIONS.md` providing architectural transparency regarding garbage collection circular references, FFI, CommonJS vs ESM, and standard library support.
- Created `COMPATIBILITY.md` detailing the active test262 test suite configuration, skipped features/categories, and recently added progressive ES2024+ features.
- Refactored `README.md` first-screen positioning text and added references to compatibility and limitation docs.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - 2026-05-20

- Reached a clean active local test262 gate: 0 errors and an empty
  `test262_errors.txt`.
- Improved WeakMap, WeakSet, WeakRef, and FinalizationRegistry handling for
  non-registered Symbol weak keys and targets.
- Fixed strict script top-level `this`, bound function `toString`, TypedArray
  descriptor behavior, BigInt typed array 64-bit wrapping, Array species
  creation, Annex B direct eval function behavior, and multiple RegExp
  Unicode/property escape paths.
- Added focused Zig regression coverage for the compatibility fixes above.
- Added public release metadata and package manifest paths.
